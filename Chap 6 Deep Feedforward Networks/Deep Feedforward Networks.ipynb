    "## Chap 6 Deep Feedforward Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep feedforward networks, also often called __feedforward neural networks__, or __multilayer perceptrons__ (MLPs), are the quintessential deep learning models. The goal of a feedforward network is to approximate some function $f^{*}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are called __feedforward__ because information flows through the function being evaluated from x, through the intermediate computations used to define f, and finally to the output y. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feedforward neural networks are called __networks__ because they are typically represented by composing together many different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to understand feedforward networks is to begin with linear models (logistic regression, linear regression) and consider how to overcome their limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pros: Efficient (Solved by closed form or convex optimization)\n",
    "- Cons: Model capacity limited to linear function \n",
    "\n",
    "To extend linear models to represent nonlinear functions of x, we can apply the linear model not to x itself but to a transformed input φ(x), where φ is a nonlinear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options for the mapping φ.\n",
    "- Very generic φ\n",
    "   - If φ(x) is of high enough dimension, we can always have enough capacity to fit the training set, but __generalization__ to the test set often remains __poor__.\n",
    "   - Very generic feature mappings are usually based only on the principle of local smoothness and __do not encode enough prior information__ to solve advanced problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manually engineer φ\n",
    "    - This approach requires decades of __human effort__ for each separate task, with practitioners specializing in different domains such as speech recognition or computer vision, and with __little transfer between domains__.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Deep learning's approach to learn φ\n",
    "    - This approach is the only one of the three that __gives up on the convexity__ of the training problem, but the benefits outweigh the harms.\n",
    "    - This approach can capture the benefit of the first approach by being __highly generic__ by using a very broad family φ(x;θ)\n",
    "    - Human practitioners can encode their knowledge to help generalization by __designing families φ(x; θ)__ that they expect will perform well.\n",
    "    - The advantage is that the human designer only needs to find the right general function family rather than finding precisely the right function."
